This is a project I "completed" on 3/11/22.
I imagine ill make more changes as I think of better thngs to do but the main functionality is done.
-This "bot" runs a selenium script every weekday at 7:20AM.
-The form is for me and my classmates to gain access to cmapus and stating we "havent had covid in the past 3 days"
